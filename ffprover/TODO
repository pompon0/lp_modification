stan -> użyteczność gałęzi

label [feature:weight]*
features -> prop actual state will close it

lcop.ml -> action_train, state_train (AKA global)
action -> calculate mcts policy
state -> calculate reward for intermediate states

target slurm: don't worry about it,
  as long as you have a standalone binary, it will work
